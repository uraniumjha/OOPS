It promotes key principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction for more modular and reusable code.\n","\n","2.What is a class in oop ?\n","  - Class is a template for creating instances\n","\n","3.What is object in oop ?\n","  - An object in OOP is an instance of a class that contains data (attributes) and functions (methods) to perform actions\n","\n","4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n","  - Abstraction hides the complexity by showing only essential features, while encapsulation bundles data and methods together, restricting direct access to some components.\n","\n","5.What are dunder methods in Python ?\n","  - Dunder methods in Python (short for \"double underscore\") are special methods, like __init__ and __str__, that allow objects to interact with built-in Python operations.\n","\n","6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n","  -  Inheritance in OOP allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent), enabling code reuse and extension.\n","\n","7.What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n","  - Polymorphism in OOP allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, enabling methods to behave differently based on the object type.\n","\n","8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using classes to bundle data (attributes) and methods, and restricting access to some of the object's internal details using private or protected attributes\n","\n","9.What is a constructor in Python?\n","  - In Python, a constructor is a special method __init__() used to initialize an object's attributes when it is created\n","\n","10.What is class and static method in python?\n","   - In Python, a class method is a method that takes the class as its first argument (cls) and is defined using the @classmethod decorator, while a static method doesn't take any reference to the class or instance and is defined using the @staticmethod decorator\n","\n","11.What is method overloading in Python?\n","   - Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, though Python does not support it natively it can be simulated by using default arguments or variable-length argument lists\n","\n","12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n","   - Method overriding in OOP occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass, allowing the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of that method\n","\n","13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n","   - In Python, the @property decorator is used to define a method as a \"getter\" for a class attribute, allowing you to access it like a regular attribute while still running a method behind the scenes. It enables controlled access to private attributes\n","\n","14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","   - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, enabling flexibility, code reusability, and easier maintenance by allowing methods to be used interchangeably across different objects\n","\n","15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n","   - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is designed to be subclassed, containing one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. It is defined using the abc module and the ABC base class\n","\n","16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n","   - OOP provides advantages like modularity, reusability, encapsulation, abstraction, and flexibility, making code more organized, maintainable, and scalable\n","\n","17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","   - A class variable is shared by all instances of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each instance of the class\n","\n","18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","   - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class\n","\n","19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python ?\n","   - The __str__ method in Python defines a human-readable string representation of an object, typically used for display purposes, while the __repr__ method defines an official string representation of the object, intended to provide a detailed, unambiguous output that can ideally be used to recreate the object.\n","\n","20.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n","   - The __del__ method in Python is a special method used for object destruction it is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing for cleanup of resources like closing files or releasing network connections before the object is removed from memory\n","\n","21.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n","   - @staticmethod defines a method that doesn't access class or instance data, while @classmethod defines a method that takes the class (cls) as its first argument and can modify class-level attributes.\n","\n","22.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n","   - In Python, polymorphism works with inheritance by allowing subclasses to define their own versions of methods that are already defined in a parent class, enabling the use of the same method name to perform different tasks based on the objects class.\n","\n","23.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","   - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement, with each method returning the object itself, allowing consecutive method calls\n","\n","24.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","   - The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function, enabling objects to behave like callable functions or methods.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aSl-rtRRBrTz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"AaiaX2po9YBV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["'''1.Create a parent class Animal with a method speak() that prints a generic\n","message.
